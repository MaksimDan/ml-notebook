    "this is an efficient algorithm for outlier detection, especially in high-dimensional datasets. The algorithm builds a Random Forest in which each Decision Tree is grown randomly: at each node, it picks a feature randomly, then it picks a random threshold value (between the min and max value) to split the dataset in two. The dataset gradually gets chopped into pieces this way, until all instances end up isolated from the other instances. An anomaly is usually far from other instances, so on average (across all the Decision Trees) it tends to get isolated in less steps than normal instances."
