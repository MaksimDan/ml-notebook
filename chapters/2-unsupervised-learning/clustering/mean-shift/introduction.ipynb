    "Mean-shift: this algorithm starts by placing a circle centered on each instance, then for each circle it computes the mean of all the instances located within it, and it shifts the circle so that it is centered on the mean. Next, it iterates this mean-shift step until all the circles stop moving (i.e., until each of them is centered on the mean of the instances it contains). This algorithm shifts the circles in the direction of higher density, until each of them has found a local density maximum. Finally, all the instances whose circles have settled in the same place (or close enough) are assigned to the same cluster. This has some of the same features as DBSCAN, in particular it can find any number of clusters of any shape, it has just one hyperparameter (the radius of the circles, called the bandwidth) and it relies on local density estimation. However, it tends to chop clusters into pieces when they have internal density variations. Unfortunately, its computational complexity is O(m2), so it is not suited for large datasets."
