    "a hierarchy of clusters is built from the bottom up. Think of many tiny bubbles floating on water and gradually attaching to each other until thereâ€™s just one big group of bubbles. Similarly, at each iteration agglomerative clustering connects the nearest pair of clusters (starting with individual instances). If you draw a tree with a branch for every pair of clusters that merged, you get a binary tree of clusters, where the leaves are the individual instances. This approach scales very well to large numbers of instances or clusters, it can capture clusters of various shapes, it produces a flexible and informative cluster tree instead of forcing you to choose a particular cluster scale, and it can be used with any pairwise distance. It can scale nicely to large numbers of instances if you provide a connectivity matrix. This is a sparse m by m matrix that indicates which pairs of instances are neighbors (e.g., returned by sklearn.neighbors.kneighbors_graph()). Without a connectivity matrix, the algorithm does not scale well to large datasets."
