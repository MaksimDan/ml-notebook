    "\n",
    "To asset how a model will generally perform in practice, we use k-fold cross-validation. The process for k-fold cross validation is simple. Make sure that the date is shuffled. This will ensure that each fold is relatively similiar and as a result won't carry drastic degrees of variance between each cross validation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the training set into k equal parts or folds.\n",
    "2. For each fold, take the current fold and treat it as the test set. Take the remaining k-1 folds and treat this as the training set.\n",
    "3. Train and test your model using the current training and test sets.\n",
    "4. Average the performance across all k trails as the summarized performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages with Cross-Validation**\n",
    "1. The entire dataset is involved in both the training and evaluation process, so it is particularly beneficial working with a dataset limited in size.\n",
    "2. Cross validation comes in as a distribution of scores, so that means obtain additional statistics such as the precision (standard deviation)\n",
