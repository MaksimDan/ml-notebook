    "Ridge is a good default without anything in mind. Use Lasso or Elastic Net if you suspect that there is some redundencies between the features. Elastic Net tends to be prefered over Lasso because it can be helpful in the context when several features are strong coorelated (redundent) or when the number of features out weight the number of training instances."
