    "Unlike logistic classifiers, SVC's do out associate a probability with the classification. However, both logistic and SVM based classifiers can be trained using gradient descent. `SGDClassifier` supoorts by default a `loss='hinge'` which is a linear svm, and `loss='log'` for logistic regression based model using gradient descent as the primary learner. Gradient descent based classifiers are built to scale better with larger datasets. There are several other SVM based implementations in https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.svm.\n",
