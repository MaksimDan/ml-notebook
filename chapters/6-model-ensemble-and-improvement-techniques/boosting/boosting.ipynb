    "The general idea in most boosting algorithms is use use other learners to correct other learners. As an oversimplified template, boosting follows these guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A predictor is trained.\n",
    "2. Another predictor is trained using the previous predictor as a corrector.\n",
    "3. Repeat 2 for some time.\n",
    "4. Using all the predictors as an enemble to form a final weighted prediction. The weighting scheme depends on the boosting algorithm. As option is to weight each predictor based on its overal accuracy on the training set.\n",

    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "* Due to the serialized dependency the algorithms cannot be parallelized and so boosting does not scale as well as other ensemble techniques.\n"
