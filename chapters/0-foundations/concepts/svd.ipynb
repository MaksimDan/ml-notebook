    "# Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD is used in different places such as PCA and Closed form matrix regression. To begin, the goal of SVD is to take an input matrix $X$ that is of shape $n \\times p$ and _decompose_ it into 3 individual terms. This kind of decomposition is always possible, and there is only ever one unique decomposition.\n",

    "The way to interpret this decomposition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In $U$ the columns correspond to the strengths of each identified concepts on a per user basis. For example, the first column might corresponds to the strength of the sci-fi concept, and the second column, to the strength of the roman concept on a per user basis.\n",
    "* In $D$ each value along the diagon represents the strength of each individual concept. For example, 12.4 as an overall concept has a high strength than 9.5, the concept for roman film. The final concept of 1.3 has low strength when compared to the other two concepts. For low strengths, the concept could just be measuring noise and potentially ignored.\n",
    "* In $V$, each row corresponds to a concept and the values in each row coorespond to the strength each particular film belongs to a concept. In the example above we have three concepts for 3 different film genres, and the value for each movie (column) corresponds to how similiar that film is to each concept."
