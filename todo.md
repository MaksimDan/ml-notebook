# Todo

* README:
    * requirements for jupyerlab extensions: ployly
    * <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers/tree/master/packages/plotly-extension>
* installing mltoolbox
    * `pip install .`
* General
    * Python hands on book: all nontrival exercises.
    * Restructure the entire book:
        * Concept:
           * Introduction
           * Theory
           * Example
* SVMS
    * Perspective 1: continue from page 204 from hands on book
    * Perspective 2: implementation of SVMs from page 84 of the python from examples book
    * Outlier detection
* Decision Trees
    * You have quite a lot of mumbo jumbo in the introduction, some of it is good, but it might still require some filtering through. Refactor the bullet points and make coherant sentences.
    * See page 221, 223, 227 on the hands on book. It walks through the cart algorithm. I think both your models implement this well, but its worth investigating again with the material from this section of the book.
* Text
    * tfidf implementation
* Refactor
    * Continuous reruns of notebooks as the utilties package changes
* Meta
    * SUMMARY.md parser into identifying, mapping, and then eventually generating the book
    * Write another parser the detects unused images or files.
* Other / Consider
    * additional notes from andrew ng


# Reminders

Note: switch it up. read from many different sources (bookmarks). keep things interesting for yourself. no need through a single book in one sitting. You learn a lot more, and this makes the work overall just more enjoyable.
